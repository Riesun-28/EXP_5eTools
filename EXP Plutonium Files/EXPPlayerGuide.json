              "Due to their size, Grung often avoided direct confrontation and preferred ambushing their prey. The most common ambush strategy was laying camouflaged and waiting for their opponents, Grung from other tribes, or quarry to venture into the range of their short bows or throwing spears. If their prey survived the initially volley of poisoned weapons, the Grung would flee across the tree tops so as not to leave any trail."
